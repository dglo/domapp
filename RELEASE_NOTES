Release notes for production domapp -- jacobsen@npxdesigns.com
=========================================================
domapp V00-00-06  6/23/2005
       Requires domapp.sbi: 235, DOM-MB packages domapp-V00-00-06
       Test with domapp-tools (DMT) V00-00-06

Upgrades/bug fixes
* HAL tagged with domapp-V00-00-06 fixes SN bug
* Added DATA_ACC_MONI_AVAIL message
* Added PONG FPGA register writes for debugging w/ logic analyzer
* Updated docs

Outstanding issues: 
* Occasionally 1 pedestal trigger out of 1000 goes missing in
  pedestal collection
* Many things are not thoroughly tested yet, notably LC
  functionality, flashers, and programmable dead time.
  Compressed data has not been thoroughly examined.
* Should implement raw data format so that compressed data
  can be compared with uncompressed in a one-to-one format.

domapp V00-00-05  6/14/2005
       Requires domapp.sbi: 235, DOM-MB packages domapp-V00-00-05
       Test with domhub-tools/domapp V00-00-04

Upgrades/bug fixes
* Lots of clean up
* FPGA bug fix in pedestal collection
* DATA_ACC_RESET_MONI_BUF message added
* Updated docs

Outstanding Issues:
* Many things are not thoroughly tested yet, notably LC
  functionality, flashers, and programmable dead time.
  Compressed data has not been thoroughly examined.
* DOM becomes unresponsive after many short tests
  where supernova data are read out.  Currently
  under investigation.
* Should implement raw data format so that compressed data
  can be compared with uncompressed in a one-to-one format.

=========================================================
domapp V00-00-04  5/31/2005  First beta release
       Requires domapp.sbi: 226, DOM-MB packages domapp-V00-00-04
       Test with domhub-tools: V00-00-03

Upgrades/bug fixes
* Flasher, supernova, LC implemented
* All planned major features now implemented (see 
  resources/doc/index.html)

Major known issues (from resources/doc/index.html):
    * Many things are not thoroughly tested yet, notably LC 
      functionality, flashers, and programmable dead time.  
      Compressed data has not been thoroughly examined.
    * DOM becomes unresponsive after many short tests 
      where supernova data are read out.  Currently 
      under investigation.

Minor Outstanding Issues:
    * A possible firmware issue exists where pedestal collection 
      ("forced triggers") fail to arrive in time (200 usec).  
      Currently under investigation.
    * Should implement raw data format so that compressed data 
      can be compared with uncompressed in a one-to-one format.
